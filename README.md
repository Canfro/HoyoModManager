A very simple and basic mod manager for XXMI/HoYoVerse games, works on Windows, Mac and Linux. Its very simple as I'm still pretty new to this, but it gets the job done!

To use just run the program once so your config file is created, then just add the directories to your XXMI mods folders in config.json, and you can click "Create Folders" button for each game; this will create the folder "HoyoModManager" and a folder for each of the game's characters inside. Put your mods folders there, sorted by characters.

The program lets you enable and disable mods by clicking them, and I will also add a randomized mode that activates 1 random mod for each character.
